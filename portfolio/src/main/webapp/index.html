        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Nick and I'm a rising sophomore at the University of Maryland, studying computer science and Math. 
          I have had a passion for learning computer science from a very early age. In High School, I loved attending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathons</a> to gain experience coding and working on a team.
          I loved attending hackathons so much that I am now an organizer for two of the student let hackathons at UMD, <a href="https://bit.camp/">Bitcamp</a> and <a href="https://gotechnica.org/">Technica.</a>

            <b>NASA GSFC</b>
            <p>
              I interned at NASA GSFC every summer between 2017 to 2018 and spring 2020. At NASA
              I worked on the Goddard Mission Services Evolution Center (<a href="https://gmsec.gsfc.nasa.gov/">GMSEC</a>) team. While working with GMSEC I worked on multiple projects from working on building a continuous integration pipeline
              to working on a library that converted queries in a custom query language to either SQL or Elasticsearch queries.

            <b>MyMCPS Helper</b>
            <p>
              During my sophomore year of high school I built an app called <a href="https://github.com/nmittu/MyMCPS-Helper">MyMCPS Helper</a>. 
              The app is used by students in my school system to check their grades and enter hypothetical grades and assignments to see how they would affect their overall grade.
              The app has over 10,000 downloads across the Google Play Store and the Apple Appstore.
