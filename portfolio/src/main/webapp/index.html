        <p>
          Hi! My name is Nick and I'm a rising sophomore at the University of Maryland, studying computer science and Math. 
          I have had a passion for learning computer science from a very early age. In High School, I loved attending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathons</a> to gain expirience coding and working on a team.
          I loved attending hackathons so much that I am now an organizer for two of the student let hackathons at UMD, <a href="https://bit.camp/">Bitcamp</a> and <a href="https://gotechnica.org/">Technica.</a>
